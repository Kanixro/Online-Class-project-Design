# Online-Class-project-Design
Description:
This is a visual design of the first view of an online-class website. I focused on creating a clear and intuitive user experience by carefully selecting colors, shapes, and layout. Each element was designed to give “soul” to the interface, making it easy for users to understand and navigate.

Key Points:

Thoughtful use of colors to guide user attention and create a harmonious feel

Use of shapes and spacing to structure information clearly

Designed for clarity and user understanding, ensuring the interface is approachable even for first-time users

Tools Used:

Adobe XD

Note: This is an early design project showcasing my approach to UX/UI principles and visual communication.
